SAML service provider side on C# without any addition plugin

Original code from https://github.com/onelogin/dotnet-saml

Modified for add addition "XML Request sign" and "Single logout request"

You can setting this Service provider project to connect with your IDP server by edit only appsettings.config file

If you still don't has any IDP for test connection I suggest tool from wso2carbon
https://wso2.com/identity-and-access-management

This tool is very easy to use just download => extract => run => config and has example configuration in website
